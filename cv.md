# About Me
Hi, my name is Denis. At the moment I am working in the field of energy at a nuclear power plant. I love challenges and competitions, as well as learning new technologies. The goal is to reach the end of this course and get positive experiences and emotions.

# Skills
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript Basics
- Git
- Gulp
- Figma / Sketch / PS

# Code example:
You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

```js
function getMiddle(s)
{
  return s.slice(Math.ceil(s.length/2)-1, Math.floor(s.length/2)+1)
}
```
